Testcase 1:
- Data from Lake Zurich (except for in- output)
- The input is variable in time with mean discharge equal to 2 m^3/s; but uniform
over the depth range of 0 to 2 m
- Output is a uniform stream of 2m^3/s betwee 0 and 1 m of depth
- Input temperature is 20°C
- Input salinity is 0.1 %
- The simulation lasts for 300 days

The result after 300 days have the same lake surface elevation as in the beginning.
Lake surface and bottom temperature are ...
