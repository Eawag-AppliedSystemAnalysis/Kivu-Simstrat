Simstrat is a one-dimensional physical lake model for the simulation of stratification and mixing in deep stratified lakes. The model was originally developed by Goudsmit et al. (2002) and has been successfully applied to lakes with different physical properties. A k-Îµ model is used to model turbulent mixing including energy transfer of internal seiches. River or groundwater inflow can be added at specific depths or as density-dependent intrusions. The newest version of Simstrat (see below) can also simulate ice/snow covers.
